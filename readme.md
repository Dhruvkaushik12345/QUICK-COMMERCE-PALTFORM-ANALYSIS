E-Commerce Sales Analysis Dashboard
Project Overview
 e-commerce sales data to explore customer trends, product performance, delivery delays, and refunds.
Data cleaned using Python (Pandas, NumPy) and visualized through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

1.	Data Cleaning & Preparation

•	Removed duplicates and missing records.

•	Standardized text formats (title case, trimmed spaces).

•	Converted “Yes/No” columns into binary flags (1 = Yes, 0 = No) for DAX compatibility.

•	Extracted Order Hour from “Order Date & Time” to analyze hourly order trends.

Exported cleaned dataset for Power BI visualization.

2.	Dashboard Features

•	KPIs and cards: Total Sales, Total Orders, Average Order Value, Refund Rate, and Delivery Delay %.

•	Visuals: Bar, Line, Treemap, and Donut charts with KPI cards.

•	Interactivity: Filters by Category, Payment Mode, and Customer Feedback.

3.	Key Insights

•	Peak Hours: Most orders occur between 10 AM – 8 PM, showing high midday activity.

•	Top Categories: Electronics and Fashion drive the majority of total sales.

•	Delivery Performance: Around 18% of orders experience delivery delays.

•	Refund Patterns: Refunds are more common when deliveries are delayed.

 Customer Sentiment: Positive feedback dominates, but negative reviews align with late deliveries and refunds.

4.	Tools & Technologies

•	Python: Data cleaning and preprocessing (Pandas, NumPy)

•	Power BI: Data modeling, DAX measures, and dashboard creation

•	CSV: Cleaned dataset for visualization

5.	Outcome

A complete end-to-end analytics workflow — from raw data to actionable insights, enabling businesses to:

•	Identify top-performing categories

•	Improve delivery and refund management

•	Understand customer behaviour patterns

•	Optimize sales strategies using visual storytelling
